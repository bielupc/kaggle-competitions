## 🔍 About

This repo holds some of the projects I created while learning to code, mode specifically, in the Python programming language. 

Most of the projects are extremely simple, or written in a poor manner, but they helped me understand the main concepts of computer programming.

The projects cover very different areas, and this served me as a playground to test my skills and find what I liked the most. 


## 🌐 Networking

Some of the projects are related to networking such as the `TCP` and `server-client chats`, which utilize `sockets` and `server-client protocols` to allow and handle the comunication of one or more users in a chat server hosted on a local network.

I also developed a `port scanner` and a `DOS attack`script that uses `multithreading`. Finally, there's also a simple mailing client that I created while learning about the `SMTP protocol` to mark as completed the exploration of all the main networking protocols. 
## 🎮 Games

Python provides a simple library names `pygame` that allows you to create some simple games. I used this library and `turtle` to develop the famous `pong game`. I also created a `GUI rock paper scissors` using `Tkinter` to play agains the computer. Even though these are not very complex projects, they helped me develop the programming logic.

## 🤖 Web Scraping and Automation

One of the most powerful fields of application that Python covers is automation, this is why I used my Python knowledge create some useful projects to automate some repetitive tasks. The `YouTube video downloader` is a great example. Having this tool as a Python script made downloading Youtube videos much faster. 

I also created a `WhatsApp Bot` that scraped some weather data from the internet using `BeautifulSoup4` and sent it directly to my phone as a WhatsApp message using the `Twilio rest API`. I also created a simple interface to select the information I wanted to obtain.


Another project regarding web scraping I created, gathered data from a webpage that contained information about a game called League of Legends. The main goal was to find the most suitable character to pick in order to counter your adversary.

Finally, I created a `management software` that allowed me keep track of my allergy symptoms and stored them in a `database` while providing a usable interface in `tkinter`.
## 🗃️ Misc.

Some other projects that can be found in the repo are some graphs and `data visualization`, some testing of the `Logger` Python module, a simple `GUI calculator` a `Many time pad decryptor` I created from a cryptography course I took.
